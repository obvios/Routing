# Routing 2.0.1

## Description
`Routing` is a SwiftUI library that decouples navigation logic from views, promoting separation of concerns, improved maintainability, and flexible programmatic navigation.

- Enforces separation of concerns by de-coupling navigation logic from SwiftUI views.
- Supports flexible programmatic navigation.
- Type-safe
- Ideal for structured, hierarchical navigation

## Requirements
- Requires iOS 16 or later.

## Installation

You can install `Routing` using the Swift Package Manager.

1. In Xcode, select "File" > "Add Packages...".
2. Copy & paste the following into the "Search or Enter Package URL" search bar.
```
https://github.com/obvios/Routing.git
```
4. Xcode will fetch the repository & the "Routing" library will be added to your project.

## Getting Started
1. Create a `Routable` conforming `Enum` to represent the different views you wish to route to.
```swift
import SwiftUI
import Routing

enum ExampleRoute: Routable {
    case root
    case viewA
    case viewB(String)
    case viewC
    
    @ViewBuilder
    func viewToDisplay(router: Router<ExampleRoute>) -> some View {
        switch self {
        case .root:
            RootView(router: router)
        case .viewA:
            ViewA(router: router)
        case .viewB(let description):
            ViewB(router: router, description: description)
        case .viewC:
            ViewC(router: router)
        }
    }
}
```

2. Add the `RoutingView` to your view hierarchy and inject a `Router` instance.
```swift
import SwiftUI
import Routing

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var router = Router<ExampleRoute>()
    
    var body: some View {
        RoutingView(router) { _ in
            router.start(.root)
        }
    }
}
```

3. Use the `Router` functions from any of your views. Here is `ViewA`.
```swift
struct ViewA: View {
    @ObservedObject var router: Router<ExampleRoute>
    
    var body: some View {
        Text("View A")
        Button("View A: Push") {
            router.routeTo(.viewA, via: .push)
        }
        Button("View B: Full screen cover") {
            router.routeTo(.viewB("Got here from View A"), via: .fullScreenCover)
        }
        Button("ViewC: Sheet") {
            router.routeTo(.viewC, via: .sheet)
        }
        Button("Dismiss self") {
            router.dismissSelf()
        }
        Button("Pop back") {
            router.pop()
        }
    }
}
```

## Programmatic navigation

Using the `Router` object you can easily control navigation programatically, here are some examples:

```swift
// Navigate to a destination using a specific navigation type
router.routeTo(.details(id: "123"), via: .push)
router.routeTo(.settings, via: .sheet)
router.routeTo(.profile, via: .fullScreenCover)

// Pop the last view from the navigation stack
router.pop()

// Pop to the root view
router.popToRoot()

// Replace the entire navigation stack
router.replaceNavigationStack(with: [.home, .profile])

// Dismiss the currently presented modal (sheet or full-screen cover)
router.dismissChild()

// Dismiss the entire RoutingView instance if it was presented
router.dismissSelf()
```

## Deep Linking Support

`Routing` provides support for deep linking using the `.onDeepLink(using:_:)` modifier.
This allows clients to handle incoming URLs and navigate to the appropriate `Routable` destination.
NOTE: The library will dismiss any sheets/fullScreenCovers automatically if needed before displaying the deep linked view.
WARNING: I recommend only adding one `.onDeepLink(using:_:)` modifier at the root of your view hierarchy.

### Usage

Attach `.onDeepLink(using:_:)` to `RoutingView` to handle deep links:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Routing

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var router = Router<ExampleRoute>()
    
    var body: some View {
        RoutingView(router) { _ in
            router.start(.root)
        }
        .onDeepLink(using: router) { url in
            // Add your logic to handle deep link here
            print(url)
            // Return the destination to navigate to for the deep link
            return .viewC
        }
    }
}
```

## Usage with TabView

- Each tab should embed its own RoutingView instance to ensure navigation is managed independently within that tab. This allows each tab to maintain its own navigation stack while using a shared router for programmatic navigation.

To ensure proper navigation behavior in a multi-tab environment, structure your application like this:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Routing

struct MainTabView: View {
    @StateObject var routerA = Router<ExampleRouteA>()
    @StateObject var routerB = Router<ExampleRouteB>()

    var body: some View {
        TabView {
            RoutingView(routerA) { _ in
                routerA.start(.rootA) // Sets the starting view for Tab 1
            }
            .tabItem {
                Label("Tab 1", systemImage: "house")
            }

            RoutingView(routerB) { _ in
                routerB.start(.rootB) // Sets the starting view for Tab 2
            }
            .tabItem {
                Label("Tab 2", systemImage: "gear")
            }
        }
    }
}


```

NOTE: As you may have noticed, currently the Router cannot be used to route to views contained in a different tab. This limitation is due to the original design of the library. This additional capability is in the works.
